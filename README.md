# Obey
A very simple game made in Java created in about 6 hours. Used as an example of what could be done using Java in my one week curriculum for teaching Java to teens of 13-17 years of age of varying programming knowledge while I was an instructor for iD Tech Camps June 2014-August 2014. Project was out of scope to use for teaching the course, so it was just an example of what could be accomplished if they continued practicing Java.
To try out the game, run the Obey!.jar executable file.
Created using the Eclipse IDE.
